# Michael_Scott_Bot
JavaScript implementation of the classic Fisher-Yates algorithm to shuffle elements each round. This concept is similar to "chore door"...with a twist!  

## Instructions
Itâ€™s your first day at Dunder Mifflin! You work in sales with Jim and Dwight. The goal is to open each door without running into Michael Scott. If you successfully avoid Michael Scott, you win. If you open a door with Michael Scott behind it, you lose the game and start over.

## How would I improve this project?
* Implement more complex algorithms 
* Although I used array shuffle, I want to test out HashMap for fun in another program
* Increase the amount of doors every round
* Generate additional feedback on the game
* Analyze data trends over a longer period of time    
* Add styling & animations 

## Installation
This is a concept project, feel free to clone & use it for inspiration on your next JS project!
