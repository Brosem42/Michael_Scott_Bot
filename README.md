# Michael_Scott_Bot
JavaScript implementation of the classic Fisher-Yates algorithm to shuffle elements each round. This game is similar to "chore door"...with a twist! 

## Instructions

Itâ€™s your first day at Dunder Mifflin! You work in sales with Jim and Dwight. The goal is to open each door without running into Michael Scott. If you successfully avoid Michael Scott, you win. If you open a door with Michael Scott behind it, you lose the game and start over. Happy playing!

## How would I improve this project?
* Implement more complex algorithms to improve user interaction
* Increase the amount of doors every round 
* Generate additional feedback on the game
* Analyze data trends over a longer period of time    
* Add complex animations 
* Compare solutions and determine if the algorithm works better with Java
